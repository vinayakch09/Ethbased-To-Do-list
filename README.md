The project idea is to make a To-do list app powered by ethereum smart contracts. In a simple to-do list web application, we use a web browser and a web server for storing all the code and data of our application. But to build a to-do list application on a blockchain you need to do something else. Instead of connecting directly to a server, you have to access your to-do list via a browser and you are going to connect to the client-side application that you will build. This client-side application is not going to talk to a web backend and a database instead itâ€™s actually going to talk directly to the blockchain. And on the blockchain, we will have our code written in ethereum smart contracts that will contain all business logic for our to-do list app. All the to-do items are going to be stored on the blockchain itself. The smart contract will contain all the tasks of our to-do list and will allow us to add new tasks, mark complete, delete tasks, etc.
